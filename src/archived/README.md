# Archived Components

This directory contains components that are no longer actively used in the application but are kept for reference or potential future use.

## Contents

- Inactive components that may be reused in the future
- Deprecated code that has been replaced with newer implementations
- Experimental features that are not yet ready for production

## Usage

If you want to reactivate any component from this directory:

1. Review the code and update it if necessary to match current application architecture
2. Move the component back to the appropriate directory (e.g., `src/components`)
3. Update imports in files that will use this component
